from Michael Pastore to All Participants:
@Judy: OK Judy, I'll try it!
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
the question is: how do people find time for all of this????? I have enough trouble keeping up with blog and sort of Facebook/My Space.
from marsee henon to All Participants:
http://twitter.com/timoreilly
from Nicholas Chase to All Participants:
Twitter has connected me to influential people who are helpful and professional at the same time. Chris is one of those people I have met. He is the real deal.
from Amber Naslund to All Participants:
Jessica, same way you find time for email and phone. You work it in to your communications with others.
from Chris Paul to All Participants:
it doesn't take much to keep twitter active
from Pariah Burke to All Participants:
@Jessica Powers: It's tough. The Flock social media browser helps.
from marsee henon to All Participants:

from O'Reilly Media to All Participants:
Someone asked: can we get a linked list of all the twitter participants? If you mean people in this webcast, the best we can do is make the chat transcript available.

from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
Michael Pastore follow me on Twitter @judyrey I can be funny, relevant & inspiring
from Nicholas Chase to All Participants:
Twitter provides a means to nd private messages, called DM or 'Direct Message'
from Christian Messer to All Participants:
Just like networking, Twitter's about relationship building, as was just said.
from Jay M to All Participants:
I am looking for original entrepreneur content/interview/book reviews 4 web magazine www.4entrepreneur.net twitter@4entrepreneur
from O'Reilly Media to All Participants:
You can either save the transcript at the end of the webcast or--better formatting--select all, copy, and paste into another file.
from Holli B to All Participants:
TO: Pariah Burke - I love using Flock and their social media apps. It's replaced FF for me.
from Yael Miller to All Participants:
of course, search.twitter.com doesn't pick up everything, my My #TOCSM tweets aren't showing up.
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
If you end up with a couple hundred contacts on Twitter who are posting mini-blogs all the time, how do you sift through any of that?
from Kent Beatty to All Participants:
Jessica - once you make a twitter a priority, you will find time for it, much more pertinent today than email communications - http://twitter.com/kent_beatty
from Yael Miller to All Participants:
@jessica TweetDeck, learn to skim, to skip, to put it down
from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
It is fun & important to interact on Twitter. Love to follow. blogged on this.
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
I will check it out. Still a skeptic, though. :-)
from Pariah Burke to All Participants:
@Jessica Powers There are various apps to help sort. Apps like TweetDeck can separate different people/tweets into groups.
from Amber Naslund to All Participants:
Jessica, tools help there. I have about 3K followers, and I use an application called TweetDeck that helps me parse into groups
from Ann Kingman to All Participants:
Tweetdeck helps a lot. Jessica, give it 30 days and you'll likely be a convert.
from Holli B to All Participants:
@kent_beatty - I agree with the priority of Twitter. It's been so beneficial to me, I make sure that I am interacting each day.
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
Jessica; Just try it. It's free to try, better than skepticism.
from Susan Murphy to All Participants:
@Jessica you work it in to your regular online comms. It's impossible to read every tweet but using tools like Twitter Search and Tweetdeck can help you find what is important to you.
from Amber Naslund to All Participants:
I agree with Ann, Twitter takes 30 days to "get"
from Nicholas Chase to All Participants:
Get past the belief that Twitter is texting for adults..it is much greater, Sir Richard Branson is following me how cool is that?
from jacob morgan to All Participants:
hey jessica, i actually limit how many people i follow, you dont have to follow everyone that follows you
from Pariah Burke to All Participants:
/agree Amber Nashlund
from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
Twitter is like a window on the world
from Laura Pexton to All Participants:
For authors or publishers, twitter is one o the best ways to increase loyalty and community among readers
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
Cool, thanks.
from Ellen Gerstein to All Participants:
Spending GOOD money, I might add. Well done book trailers are not cheap.
from Cheryl Smith to All Participants:

from Yael Miller to All Participants:
@chris, but look at the view numbers for YouTube book trailers. Not a lot.

from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
Problem with book trailers is that often you can't tell what the book is about. Not cool.

from Andy Lester to All Participants:
Also shelfari.com
from Susan Murphy to All Participants:
@Yael depends how well they are produced. Should a trailer give away everything?
from Michael Pastore to All Participants:
@yael: Same problem with movie trailers.
from Fred Ramey to All Participants:
Did 9/11 knock others out of the fiction-reading world?
from Ann Kingman to All Participants:
But Chris, I wouldn't have known to send you that book if I didn't know you from Twitter first. It was the conversation ...
from Cheryl Smith to All Participants:
Yes, shelfari is a good one.
from Lena West to All Participants:

from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:
Audiobooks work- you can process more information faster- I often buy both the hardcover and then on audible so I can "read" it faster
from Michael Hohner to All Participants:
SciFi ebooks (mobipocket) on a BlackBerry - http://knowledgenavigator.ca/2008/06/23/adding-freely-available-ebooks-to-your-blackberry/

@Michael- me too! Like DVD's with the electronic version included
from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
$$$$
from Michael Hohner to All Participants:
kindle - think of 80's colecovision looking thing ;)
from Pariah Burke to All Participants:
Film industry is doing that more now, with many DVDs released with companion disc of film for download to PC/pocket player
from matt goodwin to All Participants:
what happened?
from janica smith to All Participants:
I would definitely pay for a bundle like that!
from Sharon Jaffe to All Participants:
@chrisbrogan The movie studios are thinking of the same thing i.e. you buy a movie and get all formats bundled to watch online, DVD, download, stream etc
from Patrick Hederman to All Participants:
kindle is far superior to sony reader. if sony doesn't get wireless download capabilites, i don't see how they can stay afloat.
from Gillian Brouse to All Participants:
Google Readerfan here!
from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
Kindle does not have color for illustrated books. My ebook includes visual brain enhancing for adults

google reader is better
from Michael Schechter to All Participants:
also you can use the share through friendfeed to share great articles that you read on twitter and facebook
from Mac Slocum to All Participants:
that was google.com/reader -- Google's RSS reader
from Kat Meyer to All Participants:
google reader just did a "makeover" and it's even better now.
from marsee henon to All Participants:
How can a tech publisher do audio with tables, code, etc? Any suggestions?
from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:
yes
from Michael Sauers to All Attendees:
Love my Sony Reader. Sorry, but when I'm reading a book I don't want all the bells and whistles of being online.
from Dee Stewart to All Participants:
with publishing, some authors would love to do it, but their contract won't allow it. so i think having that discussion wth publishers is great.
from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
Any St Martin's folks here?
from Kim Dushinski to All Participants:
Kat - does that mean it looks better? (hoping so)
from Dee Stewart to All Participants:
now if the author is self-published she should consider bundling
from Ami Greko to All Participants:
@ Don--I work at Macmillan (parent company of SMP)
from Kat Meyer to All Participants:
@kim - yep, hard to explain, but go take a look...:)
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
Love that.
from Patrick Hederman to All Participants:
@michael- agreed. not for browsing purposes, but rather for on the run instantaneous downloads, without needing a computer or any wires.
from Erin Cubert to All Participants:
or newspapers!
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
A "book" is just a format.
from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:
There are other podcasts, like Word to Mouth that specifically interview authors; Mitch Joel does one for a publisher in Canada- I think podcasting and blogging makes the authors real to the readers; author readings on line, so to speak.
from Kat Meyer to All Participants:
delivering content - in many different packages
from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
@Ami --I'm working with some of your people.

from Laura Pexton to All Participants:
@jpostman just wrote SocialCorp, too, using a lot of input from his Twitter followers
from Gillian Brouse to All Participants:

from Alison Lowry to All Participants:
Christian authors should check out www.Ambassador-International.com
from Taylor Walsh to All Participants:
NING is awesome and gets better by the month
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
THANKS AMANDA!
from Natasha Netschay Davies to All Attendees:
How do you drive traffic to all your outposts?
from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
Authors must be involved.
from Christiana Briddell to All Participants:
I'm creating a platform for authors to create communities... I think the key is creating courses that build off your book, especially for how-to's. WDYT?
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
Natasha;: YOu can't drive. It's all pull.
from Kat Meyer to All Participants:
Authors often need training to get up and running. most love blogging/twittering, etc. once they try it.
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
@Natasha the greatest q of all time
from Honey Mae Caffin to All Participants:
I have to run to my next meeting. THANKS Chris Brogan and host!
from Brett Sandusky to All Participants:
Why don't authors realize that THEY have to be engaged in the success of their titles?
from Josh Rangel to All Participants:
@Whitney - Made to Stick has definitely given me some new perspective and ways to generate ideas.
from Kirk Biglione to All Participants:
@brett The smart authors do realize that.
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
What site do you recommend for Self-Publishing 101 tips/info?
from Pariah Burke to All Participants:
@Brett I think authors have a tendency to think that, for the percentage of sales the publisher apparenlty takes, the publisher should do all the marketing.
from Michael Pastore to All Participants:
There was a time when all the promotion was managed by publishers: authors could focus on writing. ... That time is gone.
from Brett Sandusky to All Participants:
@kirk Very true...it would be nice if they all did
from Kat Meyer to All Participants:
i've been working w/ authors training them on social media & had a lot of success. must start early - be4 book is out.
from Troy Corley to All Participants:
how about non-fcition books vs fiction?
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
I'm both an author (published by Knopf) and a small press (Catalyst Book Press) and I think it's overwhelming to most authors. I'm still trying to figure it out for my business, much less for me personally as an author. There are one hundred million things we should be doing, and I think most authors are still nostalgic for the time when they didn't need to be marketing.
from Troy Corley to All Participants:
a lot of info about promoting fiction
from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:
@Brett- I think the author has to be involved- the audience loves to hear from them, but by doing things on twitter, podcasts, etc. can be done remotely and give that personal experience in a wide-spectrum, long-tail way
from Michael Pastore to All Participants:
Chris: If we build it, will they come?
from Gillian Brouse to All Participants:
We've talked about reaching readers. Does the same apply to reaching publishers/agents?
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
@Jessica authors have always needed to market their own book
from Amanda MacArthur to All Participants:
@Jaculynn - Self publishing site comparisons - http://tinyurl.com/5qhnea
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
of course--but the ante has been upped
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
@gillian I think so. I make lots of author/agent contacts via Social media
from Regina Rainwater to All Participants:
at this point in social game, if an author has static blog/web presence, I rarely go back to read, those that engage me I respond to, even if I am not nec a fan of work...it can win me over as a new fan before I read work
from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
I tee my authors off. It's up to them to hit the ball.
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
Got that - thanks Amanda
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
"Top Self Publishing Firms" by Stacie Vander Pol reviews different self publishing options.
from Bruce Miller to All Participants:
What do yuo think about the mashup of content to social media
from Brett Sandusky to All Participants:
@Whitney Agreed. I would be considered the choir, come preach to some of my authors, please.
from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:
@Michael- I think you have to have patience and watch it grow; do outreach, but just like a church community or any other social group, it grows and changes over time.
from Gillian Brouse to All Participants:
Thanks Chris Webb
from jacob morgan to All Participants:
to help people out i put together a list of tools and metrics to measure success http://is.gd/bYPS

@Brett- anytime, any where
from Amanda MacArthur to All Participants:
@Whitney - totally agree. Patience is key!
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
Thanks Yael Miller. Perfect

from jacob morgan to All Participants:
how can you afford to NOT be in social media is the question?
from jacob morgan to All Participants:
you are welcome amanda
from Kat Meyer to All Participants:
@robert - maybe get help on learning how to use tools, but your voice needs to be the one involved in engaging with community. don't farm out content creation.
from Roger Penguino to All Participants:
@chrisbrogan Amazon iPhone app let's you take pix of books and automagically brings up the book page or add to wishlist
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
If you do NOT build it, they won't come.
from Susan Murphy to All Participants:
not every tool is going to be right for everyone.
from Mark Buchholz to All Participants:
Hoffspace is awesome
from Michael Schechter to All Participants:
do you think you are better off building it on existing sites or building your own?
from Susan Murphy to All Participants:
but you need to try things, see what works for your audience
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
Important to build it for your Specific Community, and not the whole world
from Michael Schechter to All Participants:
I would imagine if you are on Hoffspace you were going to think it was awsome regardless :)

from Michael Schechter to All Participants:

from Chris Webb to All Participants:

from Honey Mae Caffin to All Participants:
how do you build community by going at it alone? that seems antithetical don't y ou think?
from Brett Sandusky to All Participants:
How would you go about establishing an ROI for social media usage? Price is lower than traditional/time is more, etc.
from janet fouts to All Participants:
Agree with her or not, she's managed to build her own empire
from Roger Penguino to All Participants:
@Howard Cohen: Also use Tweetdeck lets you subscribe to Twitter searches and displays results in realtime
from Regina Rainwater to All Participants:
but HuffPost on twitter just regurgitates NYT links, so I unsubscribed
from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
Does Sony Reader support color illustrations?
from jacob morgan to All Participants:
he brett you use the metrics i mentioned
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
@brett for ROI in social media see @jasonfalls' great post on it.
from Cheryl Smith to All Participants:
my bad, 90 minutes
from jacob morgan to All Participants:
there are other things that you cant measure wiith numbers such as knowledge, business process, etc
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
@judy re: Sony Reader - no.
from Howard Cohen to All Participants:
thx Roger. Will look into it
from Lester Smith to All Participants:
Will the chat transcript be saved & available?
from Patrick Hederman to All Participants:
@judy no color on sony reader, that i'm aware of
from jacob morgan to All Participants:
but social media is more measurable than traditional media
from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
Does Kindle link to web . Can I embed links to color illustrations?
from Brett Sandusky to All Participants:
@yael: thanks! Much appreciated
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
Wait, when is this over?
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
You're welcome.
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
@judy no color display on Kindle either
from Susan Murphy to All Participants:
@jacob in what way?
from Patrick Hederman to All Participants:
@judy- you can link on Kindle reader, but the results won't be in color
from David Saracco to All Participants:
what do you think about widgets for marketing books?
from marsee henon to All Participants:
The webcast was supposed to be 90 minutes
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
Chris, what I really found helpful was your comment about how we're no longer in the "book" publishing business but the information exchange business. Thanks.
from Michael Schechter to All Participants:
looking forward to talking to more of you on twitter @scheky1068
from Bruce Miller to All Participants:
nest gen of kindle may be the device, but there are 4 now
from Bryan Buchan to All Participants:

from Amber Naslund to All Participants:
Bryan - WordPress.
from Michael Schechter to All Participants:
is it just content publishing at this poing?
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
Wordpress
from Michael Schechter to All Participants:
point :)
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
@Bryan I really like Wordpress
from Dave Jennette to All Participants:
Out. Thanks.
from Kim Werker to All Participants:
Ditto -- WordPress
from Pariah Burke to All Participants:
@Andy Excellent point.
from Bryan Buchan to All Participants:
I like wordpress too
from Lester Smith to All Participants:
WordPress is da bomb.
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
I use wordpress, too. Can do almost everything with it.
from Kat Meyer to All Participants:
Squarespace!
from Gillian Brouse to All Participants:
I like typepad - based on wordpress
from Amanda MacArthur to All Participants:
I've seen high traffic site move over to Drupal because it can "handle it better", but I still like Wordpress.
from Tim Middleton to All Participants:
Posterous is pretty cool
from Jason Griffey to All Participants:
@Gillian Brouse: Typepad isn't Worpdress, it's Moveable Type.
from Kim Werker to All Participants:
Drupal is amazing for larger communities.
from Susan Murphy to All Participants:
depends what you want to do - Tumblr is good for some people.
from jacob morgan to All Participants:
hubspot is turnkey though, not customized :(
from Kathy Ishizuka to All Participants:
Chris: We have a staff Twitter account, presently a free for all - ok? Or should there be an eye toward a singular mission.
from Gillian Brouse to All Participants:
Oh, oops. Thanks @Jason.
from Nick Martinelli to All Participants:
I use Joomla for our social sites
from David Saracco to All Participants:
Chris question- what do you think about Widgets for marketing books. Lots of buzz about it right now.
from jacob morgan to All Participants:
might be a good starting point
from marsee henon to All Participants:
A copy of this webcast will be available online at http://oreilly.com/webcasts/
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
But moveable type is good, and I just heard about Drupal from Casey at New Pages--apparently does a lot more than Wordpress, can create discussion communities, etc.
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
Brands are not social - give them all a personal account. Let them be real people.
from Dan Cotton to All Participants:
@marsee Thx
from Kim Werker to All Participants:
Drupal is a full-on content management system that is extremely extensible.
from Amber Naslund to All Participants:
Jessica: Drupal is very robust, but not for the faint of heart or rookie
from Jason Griffey to All Participants:
Drupal is a full-fledged Content Management System. More than just a blog. Although the same is more or less true of Wordpress these days.
from Jessica Powers to All Participants:
that's why I'm sticking with wordpress for now
from Maurice Cherry to All Participants:
Wordpress can be leveraged fully into a CMS, but Drupal really takes the cake.
from Ulhas Anand to All Participants:
Joomla, Drupal, Zend - there are more
from Gillian Brouse to All Participants:
brand v person -- @michael_at_dell is a hybrid
from DJ Francis to All Participants:
@ColonelTribune, btw
from Amanda MacArthur to All Participants:
We've turned Wordpress into a full-on CMS, but it was very expensive.
from Heather Francell to All Participants:
@Statesman -Austin paper does too - real human
from Kameya Shows to All Participants:
GM is also engaged in convo on twitter
from Nick Martinelli to All Participants:
Joomla is great for blogging, comments, and they is a facebook like app forit too
from Sharon Jaffe to All Participants:
@michael_at_dell isn't a real person? I'm gutted ...
from Nicholas Chase to All Participants:
Your web personality is very important, as you extend your reach, search for your name and make sure you respond to negative comments ASAP. It your reputation, protect it!
from Nick Martinelli to All Participants:
we run our cart from joomla too
from Michelle McManus to All Participants:
@ohltweets is me.
from Johnny Amos to All Participants:
@michael_at_dell is a real person
from Kirk Biglione to All Participants:
ExpressionEngine is an exceptional CMS, but not open source - though very reasonably priced
from Lester Smith to All Participants:
Thanks, Chris Brogan. Great presentation! Thanks all for rich chat. I'm out.
from Michael Pastore to All Participants:
Chris, some tips on this million-dollar question: How can we convert page views to cash?
from jacob morgan to All Participants:
where do you see social media in 2 years chris?
from Susan Murphy to All Participants:
This is all about people talking to people, not companies talking to people.
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
@Amanda in what way was it expensive?
from Alison Lowry to All Participants:
@Nick we have joomla but have a lot to learn
from Aaron Prather to All Participants:
Is there anything that sites like Digg, StumpleUpon, or Mixx may do for publishers?
from Bryan Buchan to All Participants:
Joomla rocks if you are web savy highly reccommend
from Johnny Amos to All Participants:
Kameya: Do you know any GM twitter names?
from Ulhas Anand to All Participants:
Zend is pretty stable too
from Gillian Brouse to All Participants:
@sharon - definitely a real person, but he carries the brand in his username, and obviously talks mostly dell issues
from Bruce Miller to All Participants:
what about widgets in social networking
from Amanda MacArthur to All Participants:
I agree with the personality vs. brand on Twitter. When we turned our @mequoda account from company to person, we got tons of new followers.
from Regina Rainwater to All Participants:
Starbucks is very responsive on blogs and twitter, I always get a human exchange, good example
from Nick Martinelli to All Participants:
also Joomla has a bigger presence here in the USA, drupal is bigger overseas
from Michael Schechter to All Participants:
michael, isnt it more building an audience that is willing to spend cash on your products?
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
Amazon on the other ahnd, you can't ever talk to a real person
from Morris Rosenthal to All Participants:
Chris, I hear from a lot of publishers about their Web 2.0 and Social Networking strategies, and almost invariably, they never got Web 1.0 right. How do you feel about publisher rushing into video, twitter, etc, without establishing a basis resource site for their business or enterprise, with core content that will bring them the links and visibility they are unlikely to get otheriwse, unless they are very exotic or pretty:-)
from Nick Martinelli to All Participants:
but open source CMS web systems are great compared to build custom web apps for $$$,$$$
from Kameya Shows to All Participants:
@johhnyamas http://twitter.com/GMblogs
from Bryan Buchan to All Participants:
Where is the best place to go to get paid ads on your site??
from Kent Beatty to All Participants:
Chris, a good way to manage tweets from a large # if tweeps you follow?
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
Digg gives you a "spam" option when marking down stories, and "spam" basically is taken to mean "any marekting"
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
Start by being part of the Digg, Mixx and StumbleUpon communities (for real)
from Johnny Amos to All Participants:
Thanks, Kameya!
from Amanda MacArthur to All Participants:
@Yael, it was expensive for development costs, building custom APIs to connect with Paypal, Google Analytics, WhatCounts EMS, etc.
from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
@ Christ - teleseminars are social media, How can authors use them? What is best?
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
Chris Webb nails it: YOu can't just walk in to the room and expect to be loved.
from Kameya Shows to All Participants:
@johnnyamos - NP!
from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:

good point/read re: Web 1.0/2.0: The book isn't the paper. It's the content! Why don't you understand your own product? http://tinyurl.com/6gor6x
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
@amanda but wouldn't it be the same # of money if you made for a non-blog website with all the things you wanted?
from Dan Cotton to All Participants:
Thanks Chris

"Bring wine, not a bullhorn": Just paid for the 2 hours of my time on this.
from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
Opps 1 of my Typos! Apologize. "Christ" should just be Chris. It's a questio for Chris about social marketing using teleseminars
from Amanda MacArthur to All Participants:
We have a publishing event coming up that's made to help Publishers transfer from 1.0 to 2.0 - http://summit.mequoda.com
from Morris Rosenthal to All Participants:
Chris, I think most people would agree that search is the killer app of the web, text search, yet it doesn't mesh well with the advanced web techniques. Publishers (book publishers) are in the best position of all business to attract visitors through search, lots of text content, but somehow, they don't get there.
from Michael Pastore to All Participants:
Christ probably can't handle this new media ...
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
What's a good way to print out this chat?
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
Wine and Bullhorns - I feel a blog post coming on :)
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
Judy Rey; interesting slip, there heh
from Michael Pastore to All Participants:
@yael: just select all ... Also, O'Reilly will make this chat available
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
Yael: Cut & Paste it into a word processor document.
from Robert Swanwick to All Participants:
listening and reading at the same time is one thing, but how the heck does Chris talk and read at the same time?
from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
Regina Rainwater Agree that the book is not the paper but the content!
from elyssa Timmer to All Attendees:
Wow the chatter is just as interesting as the presentation :-)
from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:
is it over?
from Amber Naslund to All Participants:
you can drive all the search you want, but if there's nothing worthwhile and useful when you GET there...
from Bryan Buchan to All Participants:
agree chat is very informatice
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
I know. I can barely "listen" and read at same time!
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
@andy @chrisbrogan is magic.
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
How does he do it??!
from elyssa Timmer to All Attendees:
funny isn't it - exercising the multitasking brain
from Robert Labossiere to All Participants:
gotta go, thank you, really good info presented in a short and snappy style
from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
Chris, Re: our exchange with CC about SL. Turns out authors are indeed selling books via SL events. It's genre/community driven but requires solid SL skills. Virtual book tours are booming in general.
from marsee henon to All Participants:
yes, this chat will be available, please email webcast@oreilly.com and we'll send you a copy.
from Lena West to All Participants:
Chris:
from Amanda MacArthur to All Participants:
@Yael, very likely. It's a lot of hard work any way you look at it, it's just the "out of the box" vs. the custom package. We wanted to build it for what we as publishers need. salesletters, email conversion, etc.
from Bryan Buchan to All Participants:
Where is the best place to go to get paid ads on your site??
from Lena West to All Participants:
Chris: gotta dash....EXCELLENT content...been Tweeting you...
from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:
Search can be expensive if you outsource it, for sure, but the basics aren't all that hard- that's why we did a "Searchcamp" in Philly- a community unconference about search
from Cheryl Smith to All Participants:
dadomatic ;-)
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
What's SL?
from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:
SL= second life
from Johnny Amos to All Participants:
Second Life
from Morris Rosenthal to All Participants:
Chris, I have two very simple websites with book content from a handful of books that draw approaching 10,000 visitors a day. That drives my paper book business, I do no other advertising, and I have a healthier ebook business than anybody I know. It's why I hear from so many publisher on the web topic, but the always stop short of putting significant content online, I believe they are simply distracted by the drive for newer web technology.
from Michael Schechter to All Participants:
Thanks as always Chris... gotta hop follow me at www.twitter.com/scheky1068

from O'Reilly Media to All Participants:
Glad you could join us, Kathy!

from Morris Rosenthal to All Participants:
@Yael fonerbooks.com is the main one, you'll laugh at the front page, I use an HTML editor from 1995:-)
from Regina Rainwater to All Participants:
commission junction is a great service, good people

from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
@natasha All ages under 25?
from Morris Rosenthal to All Participants:
Chris, that was actually my question (the dark side) and I'm a fan of YouTube, use them. What I'm against is the site that contacted me on YouTube yesterday offering me a $25 Amazon gift certificate for uploading my video to their new video site.
from Dee Stewart to All Attendees:
@Natasha teen or elementary?
from Rob Colding to All Participants:
Morris, what is your website?
from DJ Francis to All Participants:
If people focused more on helping others and creating good content - and less on making money or placing advertising - the world would be a better place AND they'd make more money.
from Whitney hoffman to All Participants:
@Natasha- Facebook is a great suggestion; what about colleges?
from Nicholas Chase to All Participants:

from Bryan Buchan to All Participants:
Thanks Chris GREAT Webinar followed you on twitter since the New Media Expo in Vegas http://twitter.com/bryanbuchan @bryanbuchan thx again!
from Ann Kingman to All Participants:
@Natasha - go where your target readers already are. If you publish in a niche (i.e., fashion), go to the fashion sites where they congregate
from Joe Kelly to All Participants:
have to find specific interests first, humour is a big one
from Amber Naslund to All Participants:
UGH Morris - it's about sustainability and growth, not transactions. Scamlicious.
from Morris Rosenthal to All Participants:
@Rob, the main site is fonerbooks.com - as I just told Yael, you'll get a kick out of the simplicty, maybe:-)
from Michael Pastore to All Participants:
Chris, if you had only 10 hours per week for new media marketing, how would you apportion your time?

from Dee Stewart to All Attendees:
@Natasha Facebook definitely but you should do events using Facebook to mobilize them offline to the next author event

@Natasha if it's music-centered then MySpace
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
There are probably people within your organization who are already utilizing Social Media on their own. Find them.
from Cindy Helton to All Participants:
@Natasha I work with high shcool and college age and Facebook is major, and as @Dee said use it to promo events. I am seeing MySpace switch to younger crowd
from Dee Stewart to All Attendees:
@Natasha NP! :) also invite them to become members of a reader advisory panel to learn what they like to do and how books can fit into that
from Dee Stewart to All Attendees:
i have three bestselling teen authors who sells 50,000 * books easy that way
from Ulhas Anand to All Participants:
@Natasha Also try FB groups and pages
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
Dee: They sell 50,000 books just w/FB?
from Dee Stewart to All Attendees:
@Jaculynn No, at mobilizing teens with Reading Advisory Panels and having them build events in their communities
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
My client does not want to switch from traditional book publishing channel
from Dave Pelland to All Participants:
Awesome thoughts/ideas Chris and everyone. Thanks for sharing!
from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
I find publishers are thrilled with any help they can get. :-)
from Dee Stewart to All Attendees:
@jaculynn Facebook makes it much easier. However, many highschoolers are also on MySpace so you have to do both
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
@Jaculynn can you tell client that web is just another way to market?
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
Ahhh. Thanks @Dee
from Nicholas Chase to All Participants:
Being real with your web presence goes a long way..Do not attempt to 'game' your audience. It can take years to recover from perceived authenticity.
from Alison Lowry to All Participants:
Where is a good place to find reviewers?
from Joe Kelly to All Participants:
bebo is big in the uk and ireland with under 20s
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
@jaculynn @Dee My wife's HS students seem to see going MySpace -> Facebook as a sort of "graduation"
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
@yael. Yep. Working on digging up case studies like Paulo. It's killing me because he has a huge following, too.
from Dee Stewart to All Attendees:
@Andy lol that is so true
from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
Facebook + 8th grade
from Morris Rosenthal to All Participants:
Chris, As a long time blogger, do you find that the search traffic has saturated with time? I know that my main blog on publishing drew around 500 search visitors a day by the time I got to a couple dozen posts, and 400 posts later, it's still around 500 visitors a day from search. Google just favors the older posts with earlier links over the newer posts, and since it's subject specific, the rest of the posts mainly compete with each other:-)
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
@Jaculynn as @chris said earlier Neil Gaiman has been online forever.
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
@Michael Pastore: See what Nicholas Chase said. You have to get IN to the world, not see it from the outside.
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
He's almost 80. Started a blog for him and working well so far.
from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:
What is Neil Gaiman's Twitter handle?
from Morris Rosenthal to All Participants:
Chris, specifically blog search.
from jacob morgan to All Participants:

from Jaculynn Peterson to All Participants:

from jacob morgan to All Participants:

from Andy Lester to All Participants:
As with everything, you can't "make" anyone do aything.
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
Neil Gaiman's blog or as he calls it "journal" online forever
from Laura Pexton to All Participants:
Chris, if you had to pick one social network to spend most of your time on, which would it be?
from Dee Stewart to All Attendees:
@Allison you need to do a market analysis when you build a marketing plan. that way you can find the demographics and psychographics of your readers. once you have that you will find where they are
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
People have to want to find your content.
from Regina Rainwater to All Participants:
oh, what about the twitter moms contro w/ motrin? another cautionary tale like Tahoe?
from Nicholas Chase to All Participants:
Remember that Web 2.0 is a community. If you are kind to your 'online neighbor' the benefits are staggering.
from Judy Rey Wassermaan Wasserman to All Participants:
Chris, what about groups, like on yahoo. I have had little success with traffic but great success in one for networking re web info
from Morris Rosenthal to All Participants:
Chris, was mainly curious if you've seen the effect, assuming you watch your server stats:-)
from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
Mia Twitters for Californication linked from their FB Fan Page. It's a whole nuther entertainment experience, feeding all the supporting content.

from Don Lafferty to All Participants:
Book characters and authors work best.
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
But only because there's value for the fans.
from Alison Lowry to All Participants:
Would love to talk to you more! @AlisonStorm
from Michael Pastore to All Participants:
O'Reilly has a great far-seeing vision -- that's what attracts me to it
from Andy Lester to All Participants:
OTOH, O'Reilly DID try an O'reilly-specific social network, and it tanked.
from Yael Miller to All Attendees:
I hope everyone on Twitter used #TOCSM so I can find you.
from Chris Webb to All Participants:
On the other hand, building sites around your brands like P2P.wrox.com to support products works well.
