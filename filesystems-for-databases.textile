* ext3 gives much faster random writes throughput than ext2.
** Maybe because the seek bundling is faster?

* But adding a disk to ext2 makes sequential writes much faster.

Only have 4 disks?  What should you do?

* RAID 5 outperforms everything else for random writes.

Make your readahead buffer about 1MB.

# Conventional wisdom

"Raid 5 is the worst choice for a database." Fast for dsequential
writes in our tests.

"Turning off atime is a big performance gain." Not in our tests,
but 2-3% for free.

"Journaling FSes have worse performance than non-jounraling."
Turning it off improves perfornance, but there are edges cases and
differenes we could not explain.

"Striping doubles performance."  Performance is better, but nowhere
near double.

Your reader-ahead buffer is not big enough.  Make it 8MB.
