# Wordpress as CMS

2/19/2013 at Bucketworks

WP powers 15% of the top million web sites.

When creating a custom post type (CPT), make sure to check the "save
the permalinks" box.

Go look up "WordPress template hierarchy" to know exactly how WP
searches for stuff.

Options of metadata:
* Super CPT
* WP Alchemy
* Advanced Custom Fields

Post relationships:
* Use Scribu's Posts-to-Posts plugin to tie together different CPTs

Thinking of Empire taxonomy:
* Venue
    * Google Maps of venues
* Band
* Label
* Person
* Dates
