# Becoming a polyglot

Tatsuhiko Miyagawa

Miyagawa now works for Cookpad.com

Thaings I like in Ruby
* Everything is an object
* More Perlish than Python
* Diversity matters = TIMTOTWTDI
* Meta programming built in and encouraged
* Use of ! and ? in method names

Small things I like
* Omit self all around
* Everythign is expression
* No need to type ";" (unlike Python)
* Implicit better than explicit
* block, iterators and yield
* No semicolons, 2-space indent
