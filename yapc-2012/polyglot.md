# Becoming a polyglot

Tatsuhiko Miyagawa

Miyagawa now works for Cookpad.com

Thaings I like in Ruby
* Everything is an object
* More Perlish than Python
* Diversity matters = TIMTOTWTDI
* Meta programming built in and encouraged
* Use of ! and ? in method names

Small things I like
* Omit self all around
* Everythign is expression
* No need to type ";" (unlike Python)
* Implicit better than explicit
* block, iterators and yield
* No semicolons, 2-space indent

Ruby mixins

! and ? make it clear that a method is an imperative or query

Ruby ecosystem
* Embrace changes
* Try something new, adopt it if it's good

Ruby embracing changes
* RAA -> RubyForge -> Rubygems
* Rails 2 + Merb = Rails 3
* HAML, CoffeeScript, Sass/SCSS

Creating Ruby gems is easy.

    gem build yapc.gemspec
    gem push yapc-0.0.1.gem
