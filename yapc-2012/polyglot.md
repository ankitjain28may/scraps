# Becoming a polyglot

Tatsuhiko Miyagawa

Miyagawa now works for Cookpad.com

Thaings I like in Ruby
* Everything is an object
* More Perlish than Python
* Diversity matters = TIMTOTWTDI
* Meta programming built in and encouraged
* Use of ! and ? in method names

Small things I like
* Omit self all around
* Everythign is expression
* No need to type ";" (unlike Python)
* Implicit better than explicit
* block, iterators and yield
* No semicolons, 2-space indent

Ruby mixins

! and ? make it clear that a method is an imperative or query

Ruby ecosystem
* Embrace changes
* Try something new, adopt it if it's good

Ruby embracing changes
* RAA -> RubyForge -> Rubygems
* Rails 2 + Merb = Rails 3
* HAML, CoffeeScript, Sass/SCSS

Creating Ruby gems is easy.

    gem build yapc.gemspec
    gem push yapc-0.0.1.gem

Stealing from Ruby
* Web::Scraper was inspired by ScrAPI in Ruby
* Learned how to write DSL in Perl
* Married with HTML::TreeBuilder

Little issues: DSL for Perl
* I thought it is a good idea
* Difficult to mix with classes / OO code
* text and hash keys are weak to typos

Stealing ideas
* Don't just borrow the idea. Copy it
* Copy the ecosystem too.

Cross-language pollination
* Mechanize, Mime-Types, ack, etc

Publish your code on github

Naming differences
* Perl naming: Description, boring, ::Simple
* Python: Descriptive, confusing, py*, *py
* Ruby: Fancy, creative, chaotic
* except for frameworks: Django, nbottle, Catalyst, Dancer, Mojolicious
