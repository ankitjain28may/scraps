# YAPC recap

* ack 2.0

* Moose
    * It's a great class factory, but we're not in the business of writing class factories.

* Mojolicious
    * Framework is very popular.
    * Client looks very featureful, and it would be great if it
    were better than WWW::Mechanize or, even better, Test::WWW::Mechanize.

* Big data and PDL
    * Lots of cool stuff, but it's all numeric.  Looked cool to do
    luminosity analysis of galaxies, but that doesn't help us.
    * I need to go back to school to take a statistics class.

* PaaS shootout
    * Waste of time.  All it said was that there are these vendors
    who provide these services, and the speaker told us nothing
    that would let us differentiate between them.

* Web security 101

* Polyglot w/Miyagawa

* Doing Things Wrong, chromatic

* Perl 6 lists

* Tweakers Anonymous
    * "The F keys are not just to skip tracks in your music player."
    * Keep your configs in git.  You will screw them up.  This will save you.
    * Make your editor `chmod +x` when you create a `.pl` file.
    * Run `perl -c` in the background of vim using `flymake`.  You can also run `Perl::Critic` stuff.

* Exceptional Exceptions
