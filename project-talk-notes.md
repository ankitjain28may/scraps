* Consider carefully how the outside world sees your project.

* have a good README

* There is not enough visibility for downloads.

* Have a separate project home page, for when/if github ever gets
leapfrogged again, or if you don't like changes that people have
made.  Plus, easier to remember.  Bucardo example.  Show example
of tidyp page with nothing but download links.

* Releases matter.  Don't get lost in the echo chamber and forget
your users.
