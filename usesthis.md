# Who are you, and what do you do? (Try to keep this brief!)

I'm Andy Lester and I'm a programmer and writer.  I work with open
source all day, and by night I try to help people be happy in their
jobs.
I write a lot and give technical talks.

I've written a lot of
[Perl modules on the CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~petdance)
and I'm working on version 2.0 of the
[ack search utility](http://betterthangrep.com).
I wrote a book called
[Land the Tech Job You Love](http://pragprog.com/book/algh/land-the-tech-job-you-love)
for technical people looking for jobs.

I run a number of websites:

* petdance.com, my tech &amp; jobs blog
* perlbuzz.com, a Perl news site
* bobby-tables.com, a site for teaching newbies how to avoid SQL injections

# What hardware are you using?

At work I've got a big honkin' iMac and a little monitor off to the
side.  I can't even remember how we got by with single monitors
before.  I'm in love with the
[Apple keyboard](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/B)
which is my favorite keyboard since the
[Northgate OmniKey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northgate_Computers)

For personal use I have a MacBook Pro named
[plankton](http://twitpic.com/6j2fdv).

My phone is a Droid 4, because I require a physical keyboard.
Without a physical keyboard, I have to look down to type.  I touch
type all day on the computer on my desk, and then I type more on
the computer on my lap, so why would I want to give that up when
I'm using the computer in my pocket?
