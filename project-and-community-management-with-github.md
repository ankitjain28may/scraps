# Project and Community Management with Github

Managing an open source project is more than managing code.  Managing
the contributors and community is a big part of it, too.  Github's
collaboration tools make this easy, but also bring certain challenges
to project managers used to other code management systems.

# Project and Community Management with Github

github.com has taken open source by storm, but it's more than just
a code repository with the latest hot source control system.  It's
a new way of working with open source projects, and the people in
the communities around them.

In this session, we'll discuss the human and workflow aspects of
github-based projects.  Topics will include:

* Lower barrier to entry on projects means more people submitting
changes.  This presents new code and new challenges.

* Managing human expectations about code changes

* The change in emphasis from distributions to source trees

* Using the github fork network to understand user wants

* Changing workflows to minimize impedance mismatch with new users
of the project

* Creating a project guidemap to help manage workflows and expectations

* Keeping technical changes publicly visible to the community
