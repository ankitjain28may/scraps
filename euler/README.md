# Project Euler work

Reminded of Project Euler by Seth Tisue's
[Project Euler work](https://github.com/SethTisue/Project-Euler),
I figured it would be a good way for me to start learning new
languages, too.

Seth says: "If all the pure math gets old try poker (no. 54),
Monopoly (no. 84), or Sudoku (no. 96)"

# What is Project Euler?

http://projecteuler.net/

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
