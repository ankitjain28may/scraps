Perl isn't a programming language.  It's a life support system for CPAN.

Acme::Don't: Syntax check your code without executing it.

"No questions, Uri." ++


module Acme::Don't;
use v6;
sub don't (&) is export {}

Lessons:
* No homonyms in Perl 6
* No cargo-cult vestigials
* Fewer implicit behaviours
* A little more typing required
* Still obviously Perlish

IO::Insitu
Lessons:
* Parameter lists really help
* Smarter open() helps too
* Roles let you mix in behviours
* A lot less typing required
* Mainly because of better builtins

Smart::Comments
Lessons:
* Macros kick source filters' butt
* Mutate grammar, not source
* Still room for cleverness
* No implementation yet has full macro support
* No implementation yet has STD grammar

Perl 6 is solid enough now.  Start thinking about porting modules.
