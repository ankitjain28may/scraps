PMD: PHP Mess Detector
PHP_Depends

Gives a list of extensions.  Maybe Perl::Critic should include an
inventory of modules used?

Static audit:
* Process large quantities of code
* Process the same code over and over
* Depends on auditor expert level
* Automates searches
* Make search systematic
* Produces false positives

Found three different classes with the same name, but three different
source files.

Application inventory
* Taking a global look at the appliction
* List of structures names
* List of used functionalities

5.3 migration
* Incomplete evolutions
* Obsolete functions
* Reference handling
* References with the "new" operator
* mktime() doesn't take 7 parameters any more

Summary of classes and properties makes it easy to see inconsistencies.

Has an inclusion network, like my Dev/xreq, but graphical
* include* and require*
* Ignores variables
* Circles represent files, arrows represent inclusions
