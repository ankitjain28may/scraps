New replication tools

SE-Linux security label support.  Extends SE stuff into the database
to the column level.

Writable CTE: Common Table Expressions

Makes writing partitions easier.
Find blog post "Upserting via writable CTE"

Per-column collation orders

Extensions: Postgres-specfiic package management for contrib/,
PgFoundry projects, tools.  Like Oracle "packages".

K-nearest Neighbor Indexes

Unlogged tables: Only living in memory.

Serializable snapshot isolation: No more "select for update".  No more blocking on table locks.

Foreign data wrappers
* Remote datasource access
* Initially implemented text, CSV data sources
* Underway currently: Oracle & MySQL sources
* Good for imports and things that would otherwise fail if you just used COPY
* Nothing other than sequential scans are possible.
* Expect tons of FDWs to be implemented once we get 9.1 to production
